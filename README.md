Group Name: Mana Point Studios

Game Description:

You are playing as an evil Queen who's trying to take down a monarchy run by the King. 

This will be a grid-based roguelike (limited to 3 rounds) where you will have to move around and take down 3 rounds of enemies. In a Battle, you'll be able to move, fight, or run. Running will let you avoid the fight, but at the expense of one of your stats.

The stats of the PC (Player Character) are HP, Attack, Defense, Movement, & Range. These will be upgradable in the Shop using Skill Points you obtain during your battles.

We are implementing game states and shaders into our gameplay.
